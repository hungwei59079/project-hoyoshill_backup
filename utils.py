# Computational Physics Final Project 

## Topic
Monte Carlo computation of spin-1/2 Heisenberg model

## Introduction and Expected Achievement
Spin system provides a model for describing various physical system, which is crucial in manybody physics. It allows us to study the solid states physics and quantum chemistry. In particular, the Heisenberg model [1] is a fundamental paradigm for the spin-spin interaction in solid. It can be used to explain the magnetic properties of solid. However, solving the quantum manybody system is computationally challenging due to the large Hilbert space that grows with the system size. Monte Carlo method [2-3] gives a alternative way to compute integration in high-dimensional integration with lower computational complexity, which is useful in quantum mechanics calculations. By using the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) [4], we could sample the large Hilbert space with probability that follows the Boltzmann distribution, allowing us to calculate the expectation values of certain physical parameters. In this work, we apply the quantum Monte Carlo method to slove the physical parameters of the Heisenberg model. We study the magnetic susceptibility and the correlation length, and investigate the finite-size scaling of the Heisenberg model. These are essential for us to understand the physics behind Heisenberg model.
